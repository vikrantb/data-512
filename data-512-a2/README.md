# Bias in Data
1 README file in .txt or .md format that contains a brief summary of the assignment goals, and links to the Figshare datasets, the Detox wiki page, and the Perspective API repository on GitHub.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to identify what, if any, sources of bias may exist in various Wikipedia talk corpus datasets, and to develop testable hypotheses about how these biases might impact the behavior of machine learning models trained on the data, when those models are used for research purposes or to power data-driven applications. 

Google data scientists used these [annotated datasets](https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731) to train machine learning models as part of a project called Conversation AI. The models have been used in a variety of software products and made freely accessible to anyone through the Perspective API. 

As part of this assignment project, we want to study these datasets and try to identify potential biases or potential unintended negative consequences.
