If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.

111032	`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter. Ovadya Yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. Would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? No way. They are machmir. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You just can't make this stuff up, Danny. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I dunno. I seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Stop trying to re-make the ultra-Orthodox in your own image. Its not good history. Frankly, I don't care what is on your resume. It doesn't justify writing such nonsense.

Is accusing them of creating the Holocaust an act of tolerance?

Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.  But insofar as height has a ``natural`` component, it is' present at birth in the genome.  It is just that whatever genes code for height do not manifest themselves immediately.  But they are there at birth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.  How else are we to distinguish a physical feature like height (that heritable part of it) from physical features like scars  which appear later in life and do mark the body noticably, but which are clearly not ``natural?`` `	2003	True	article	random	train
